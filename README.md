# Alien Invasion
This project was described in the book `Python Crash Course: A Hands-On Project-Based Introduction to Programming` written bu `Eric Matthes`.

This is my implementation of that project.

## Description
Alien invasion is a game where the player controls a spaceship. The player can move this spaceship and fire bullets at aliens. As the leves progress, the aliens will increase their speed. The spaceship should not touch the aliens. After the aliens have reached the spaceship 3 times, it's Game Over for the player.
